Developed by [Primevise](https://primevise.com)

> [!NOTE]
> Oversee is still rather incomplete and only has the very basic features. It might significantly change and break things before a stable release.

## Installation

```bash
$ bundle add oversee
```

and then mount the engine in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Oversee::Engine => "/oversee"
end
```

Ideally, you'd want to limit access to the dashboard to only authorized users.
